Issues -
1) Code merge conflict
2) Record Sharing 
3) CPU limit exceed
4) conflict btw validation rule & Flow


Implement & Inhanced the functionality -
1) bypass logic for validation rule using custom setting (for user or profile) 
2) increase the code coverage 
3) optimize the code by Avoid hardcoded, Avoid SOQL inside loop and call the handler class only when the condition match otherwise it will not call the handler class.
4) omni channel
5) configure community cloud for partner user.
6) convert the 204 workflow to 26 flows.()
Case object they have created 30 record type based on the business requirement. so we have analysis all the conditions of workflow based on each record type. then we deisgn the flow for each record type and also some generic which similiar conditions
7) Dynamic record page

why you want to switch from current company
